# best-repo-ever
for Salesforce trailhead
This is a readme that can be created with creating a new repository (repo) (done in my case through GitHub). Repos seem like they represent a project (or possibly an application)

This file can be tracked.

Files created, updated, or updated are in the "working" tree.

To add to version control, we create a collection of files that represent a discrete unit of work. That is built in the staging tree.

When the collection in staging is complete, we take a snapshot of everything in the staging tree. This is called a commit.

Git commands assemble the staging group and do the commit.  (git add and git commit). There are flags on these commands.
